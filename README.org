* C128-Tanks!

** What is this?

This is a very simple 2-player versus game designed for the Commodore 128 for a
short talk I gave about how to write games for old computers, and should prove
as a good starting point for folks looking to learn how to write code for this
old machine.

The design is very simple, and the code repository is laid out in such a way
that you can watch the evolution of the codebase as I develop it by switching
and diffing between the "techtalk-step-N" branches.

** What tools do I need to build this myself?

You'll need a recent build of the ACME cross assembler and a traditional POSIX
development environment (ie: make and shell).

** What's the license?

Assume GPLv2.
